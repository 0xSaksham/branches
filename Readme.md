# Rust Code Showcase

This repository contains a collection of Rust code snippets that demonstrate various concepts in the Rust programming language. The code covers topics such as conditional statements, loops, and control flow. Let's explore what each section entails:

## 1. Simple Conditional Statement

The `main` function begins with a basic conditional statement that checks if a number is less than 5 and prints either "True" or "False" accordingly.

## 2. Else If Statement

The `else_if` function showcases an example of an "else if" statement. It determines whether a number is even or odd and prints the result.

## 3. If in Let Statement

The `if_in_let` function demonstrates the usage of the `if` statement within a `let` statement, showcasing Rust's expressive syntax.

## 4. Infinite Loop

The `infinite_loop` function contains a loop that runs indefinitely, demonstrating how to create an infinite loop and stop it using CTRL+C in the terminal.

## 5. Using Continue in a Loop

The `use_continue` function exhibits the `continue` keyword in a `for` loop, skipping even numbers and printing only the odd ones.

## 6. Value from Loop

In the `value_from_loop` function, a loop accumulates a counter until it reaches 10, then breaks, returning the counter multiplied by 2.

## 7. Named Loops

The `named_loops` function showcases nested loops, including a named loop (`'counting_up`), breaking out of the outer loop based on specific conditions.

## 8. While Loop

The `while_loop` function illustrates a simple `while` loop that counts down from 3 to 0, printing the current number in each iteration.

Feel free to explore, modify, and use these code snippets as a reference for learning Rust programming concepts. If you have any questions or improvements, please don't hesitate to contribute or open an issue.

Happy coding in Rust! ðŸ¦€
